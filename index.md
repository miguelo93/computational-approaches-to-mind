## Computational Approaches to Mind and Life

An online event seminar on the “computational approaches to mind and life” - The event will bring together researchers with expertise in various areas such as complexity science, deep & reinforcement learning, as well as theoretical neuroscience & philosophy to explore different approaches in the study of the (biological and/or artificial) mind: 

1. What are those approaches essentially about? 
2. What are major benefits & caveats? 
3. Do different approaches speak to, complement, or contradict each other? 
4. What would bring research in the computational sciences forward?
